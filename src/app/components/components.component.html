                                         If you’re looking for the best makeup (and we know you are), a good place to start is with our bestsellers. Read thousands of reviews from fellow makeup-lovers and find top rated products for your beauty routine. If you’re still having a hard time finding the perfect product, check out our buying guides and quizzes or consult millions of users in our Sephora Community.                                       
                                         Make sure you have a solid foundation with the perfect primer – this will ensure that the rest of your face makeup goes on smoothly and lasts longer. Next, it’s time for concealer. If you need just the right shade, refer to our Color IQ to make sure everything matches up. Color IQ can also help you find the best foundation shade (and even brand) for your coverage needs. Some of the most popular foundation brands include NARS, Stila and Fenty.
